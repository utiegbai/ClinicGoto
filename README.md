# ClinicGoto
Clinic Go To is an online platform that connects healthcare providers with available clinic spaces to consult with their patients. It also connects patients with available healthcare providers closest to them at the time they need urgent care.

In medical practice there is a disproportionate use of healthcare resources and facilities. We are trying to change this by providing access to the under-utilized healthcare facilities and taking the pressure off the over- utilized ones.

We work with accredited healthcare facilities and providers that have been screened and have met State and Federal standards. It is completely free to sign up. Register your healthcare facility today for screening and approval.
